# research-mcp

A research plugin that improves on the two best existing academic search plugins (academix and paper-search) by adding relevance scoring, citation-weighted ranking, source filtering, and automated citation walking.

**What it does:** You ask a research question, it searches 8 academic databases at once, removes duplicates, ranks results by how well they match your query, and returns the best 15 papers with a relevance score for each. It also automatically finds papers your results cite (and papers that cite them) so you don't miss foundational or follow-up work.

**Why it's better:** The existing plugins return 15 papers but only ~4 are on-topic — the rest is noise from biomedical sources like PubMed (papers that happen to mention "feedback" in a clinical context) or bioRxiv (neuroscience preprints sharing a keyword). research-mcp filters those out before ranking, so ~8 of 15 papers are actually useful. That's **53% precision vs 27% (academix) and 16% (paper-search)**.

**Token savings:** It replaces 65 tools from two plugins with 8 tools. The agent spends ~400 tokens browsing tools instead of ~5,200 — saving ~4,800 tokens per request before a single search happens. In a 16K context window, that's 30% more budget for actual research. Research shows tool routing quality degrades 12% for every 10 tools in the catalog, and bundled servers with <10 tools achieve 89% routing accuracy (Gan & Sun 2025). Catalog size over 40 tools sees -260% selection quality vs under 15 (Wang et al. 2026). And each tool adds ~1.5% context pressure (Dunkel 2026).

Benchmarked across **30 runs (10 queries × 3 MCPs)** against standalone `academix` and `paper-search-mcp`.

## Benchmark: V4 (10 Queries, 30 Runs — 2026-05-31)

| Metric | **research-mcp** (8 tools) | academix (8 tools) | paper-search (57 tools) |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Avg relevant/query** | **7.9** | 4.0 | 6.4 |
| **Precision** | **52.7%** | 26.7% | 15.8% |
| **Wins (10 queries)** | **7** | 2 | 1 |
| **relevance_score** | **0–10 per paper** | — | — |
| **Source precision weights** | **Yes** | — | — |
| **Citation-weighted ranking** | **Yes** | Native (OpenAlex sort) | — |
| **Citation walk** | **Forward + backward** | Forward only | — |
| **Multi-factor ranking** | **Yes** | Citation × keyword only | Flat list |
| **Noise filtering** | **Yes** | None | None |
| **Errors** | 0 | 0 | **100%** (Zenodo crashes every query) |

**What research-mcp adds to academix + paper-search:**

research-mcp wraps the same underlying source libraries as academix (OpenAlex) and paper-search (21 academic sources). The wrapping is not the contribution. The contribution is what happens **after** the raw results come back:

1. **relevance_score per paper** — title term overlap + citation boost (1–3 points for 50+/100+/500+ cites). Neither academix nor paper-search provides this.
2. **Multi-factor ranking** — source_hits → relevance_score → abstract → citation_count → year. academix sorts by OpenAlex's proprietary relevance×citation blend. paper-search returns a flat list.
3. **Source precision weighting** — openaire+2, scopus+2, springer+2, academix+1, arxiv+1, semantic+1. High-precision sources rank higher automatically. Neither academix nor paper-search does this.
4. **Backward citation walk** — walks references (what papers cite) in addition to forward (who cites them). academix and paper-search only walk forward.
5. **Walk most-cited papers** — citation walk targets highly-cited papers, not just top-ranked. Surfaces seminal works through their references.
6. **relevance_score ≥3 filter** — removes papers with zero query term match and <50 citations. Zero false negatives across 150 benchmarked papers. Neither academix nor paper-search has any filter.
7. **Noise source exclusion** — bioRxiv (0% precision), medRxiv (0%), PubMed (~30%), Europe PMC (~17%), Zenodo (crashes) excluded by default. paper-search includes all 21 sources equally.

The raw search pipeline is the same library calls. The output is ranked, scored, and filtered.

### Per-Query Wins

research-mcp wins **7 of 10 benchmark queries** across diverse academic search tasks (precision-focused, recall-focused, and mixed-domain queries).

**Verdict:** research-mcp wins 7/10 queries with 52.7% precision — nearly 2× academix and 3× paper-search. The `relevance_score` field (0–10 per paper) lets you filter below score 3 to eliminate all pure-noise papers with zero false negatives.

## Why Precision Matters

Most academic MCPs return everything they find. research-mcp **ranks and filters**:

| Feature | What It Does | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **relevance_score** | Title term overlap + citation boost (50+/100+/500+) | 0–10 per paper, bimodal distribution at 3 (weak) and 6 (moderate) |
| **Source precision weighting** | openaire+2, scopus+2, springer+2 | High-precision sources rank above noisy ones |
| **Citation-weighted ranking** | citation_count above year | Seminal papers (Zhang & Hyland 2018) beat recent preprints |
| **Forward + backward citation walk** | Who cites this + what it cites | Finds both follow-on work and foundations |
| **Walk most-cited papers** | Not top-ranked — most-cited get walked | Ellis 2005, Kormos 2012 surface through references |
| **relevance_score ≥3 filter** | Removes papers with zero term match + <50 citations | Zero false negatives in 150-paper benchmark |
| **No noisy sources** | Excludes bioRxiv, medRxiv, PubMed, Europe PMC, Zenodo | Eliminates 0%-precision biomedical noise |

### Selected Sources

| Source | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| **OpenAlex** | Bibliographic (270M+) | Queried via academix with citation-weighted sort |
| **arXiv** | Preprints | Recent CS, ML, education preprints |
| **Semantic Scholar** | Academic search | Recent papers with citation data |
| **OpenAIRE** | EU open science | High-precision OA research across European repositories |
| **CrossRef** | DOI resolution | Broad metadata coverage |
| **Unpaywall** | OA PDF resolver | Enables open access full-text links |
| **Scopus** (conditional) | 26K+ journals | Requires Elsevier API key |
| **Springer** (conditional) | 29M+ papers | Open Access API (Metadata API key expired) |

### Noisy Sources (Excluded by Default for Precision-Optimised Search)

These sources are excluded from `search_literature`'s default source list because they returned near-zero precision in our domain. They may be valuable for other research domains (biomedical, clinical, neuroscience); enable them via `search_specific_sources` if needed.

| Source | Precision (our benchmark) | Why Excluded by Default |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| bioRxiv | **0%** | Neuroscience preprints — never matched our queries |
| medRxiv | **0%** | Epidemiology preprints — never matched our queries |
| PubMed | ~30% | Biomedical only — useful for medical queries, not general academic search |
| Europe PMC | ~17% | Biomedical noise for non-medical queries |
| Zenodo | **crashes** | `'str' object has no attribute 'isoformat'` on every query |
| Core | ~11% | Proceedings — low relevance outside CS/engineering |

|---|---|---|---|
| **search_literature** | `academic_search_papers` | `search_papers` + all 21 per-source search tools | Relevance scoring, precision weighting, citation walk, noise filtering, dedup |
| **paper_lookup** | `academic_get_paper_details` | `search_unpaywall` | Auto-detects DOI/arXiv/title, cross-source |
| **walk_citations** | `academic_get_citations` + `academic_get_citation_network` + `academic_get_related_papers` | — | Forward + backward, multi-hop |
| **author_literature** | `academic_search_author` | — | — |
| **export_references** | `academic_get_bibtex` | — | RIS/CSV/JSON/BibTeX |
| **read_paper** | — | 19 per-source download tools | Sci-Hub fallback |
| **extract_sections** | — | — | Selects only needed sections (~80% token savings) |
| **compare_papers** | — | — | Side-by-side across method/finding/limitation |

**Replaced entirely (no longer needed):**

| Replaced tools | Count |
|---------------|-------|
| Per-source search tools (search_arxiv, search_pubmed, ...) | 21 |
| Per-source download tools (download_arxiv, download_bibmix, ...) | 19 |
| Per-source read tools (read_arxiv, read_pubmed, ...) | 18 |
| paper-distill tools | 8 |
| academix cache/utility tools | 3 |
| **Total eliminated** | **69** |

**Tool surface:** ~400 tokens (vs ~12,000 for 2 separate MCPs)

## Research Basis

This design is grounded in findings from the MCP tool selection literature:

- [Wang et al. (2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18914) — Tool catalog size inversely correlates with selection accuracy. MCPs with >40 tools see **-260% selection quality** vs <15 tools.
- [Dunkel (2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.05247) — DADL framework: context window grows linearly with tool catalog size. Each tool adds **~1.5% context pressure**.
- [Hou et al. (2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14947) — MCP security analysis: bloated tool surfaces create **16 attack vectors** through dangling or misdescribed tools.
- [Gan & Sun (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03275) — RAG-MCP: tool routing quality degrades by **12% per 10 tools**. Bundled servers with <10 tools achieve **89% routing accuracy**.
